# Rocket Boost

Strap into your rocket and test your piloting skills against the pull of **custom moon gravity**. Every level challenges you to carefully manage your **boost** as you navigate obstacles, avoid crashes, and reach the next checkpoint. The further you go, the tougher the journey becomes.

Use precise controls, balance thrust and rotation, and master the art of momentum. Land too hard and you’ll explode; drift too far and you’ll never make it. Only steady hands and sharp reflexes will carry you to victory.
